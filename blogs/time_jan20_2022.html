                           <h2>Consider Feedback or Constructive Criticism of a Good Person as a Gift</h2>
                           <p>People always like to through out criticism in bad times. It is very difficult to accept all the criticisms, especially when something is not right. It can come from various types of people. It is a good idea to accept feedback or criticism from a good person. It generally comes in the format of suggestions or advice. Not everyone can accept it. But, people with a growth mindset can catch the tone and improve upon it. Some people become very aggressive when others throw suggestions/advice at them. No one is perfect. There is always room for improvement in behavior, skills, work, capability, etc. Sometimes, people say, "If you are the best in the room, probably you are in the wrong room" or something like that. People who throw these types of words, don't judge them quickly. Many of them want you to improve or fail. You just need to filter out good things and accept.</p>

                           <p>Various people around you want you to improve and be successful. Some of the obvious good people are parents, and teachers. In my opinion, every parent wants their children to be successful. Similarly, many teachers want this. I can give an example. When I was a high-school student, I studied in a village school (actually, I spent my childhood in a village up to high school). There were many teachers and many scenarios. I would particularly say about Bangla's teacher in tenth grade. One day our teacher came to class and gave a task (write the answer to a question). Everyone wrote and submitted the script. I did the same. But he was not happy. He criticized my write-up in front of everyone and it was a little attacking word. Many of my classmates laughed at me and I was not happy at all. I took it personally. But then I realized he wanted me to improve. That is a kind of guideline or advice that will keep students like me on track from time to time. I improved on that subject. Probably, I was the first to get A+ on that subject from our school in the grading system. I am grateful to the teacher and thank god that I realized the gift. Nowadays, I thank all people who threw or throw such words at me. Everyone has a perspective. I respect others.</p>

                           <p>We will also find people around us who do not help us to improve but pretend to be friends. Sometimes, a person can lose track after getting some complacent words from surrounding people. It is not good. In my opinion, a good person can praise you in the same s/he criticizes you. Only praiseworthy words would lead a person to complacency. Similarly, random suggestions do not work either. So, as a person, it is a good idea to filter our words that we do not need and accept feedback or criticism as a valuable gift. Nobody can satisfy every other persons' expectation. And it a foolish to want to do so. But at least we can improve upon good ones and ignore others.</p>

                           <p>Probably, there are many formats of feedback or constructive criticism. I understood it when I was doing an internship. In the company environment, feedback really helps to improve. We just need to have the mentality of accepting it and placing it in the right direction. Sometimes, it is not obvious but people with growth mindset can sense it or filter. I hope that a good feedback culture can bring something good to society. </p>
