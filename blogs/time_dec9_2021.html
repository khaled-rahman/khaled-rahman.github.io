                           <h2>Start early if you have a plan for higher study</h2>
                           <p> I started my Ph.D. studies almost after 4 years of my BS graduation. It's too much. When I started, I saw that some other Ph.D. studies were more than 3 years junior to me. They are from different countries such as the USA, CHINA, INDIA, etc. That means they do not wait after BS graduation. If someone wants to do a master's or Ph.D., in most cases, they immediately start it after the BS graduation. Because it is supposed that the international students carry 0 years of experience from home country to the USA. So, if someone finishes the MS or Ph.D. early, probably s/he is one/two steps ahead than who graduates and starts a job later. Thus it is always a good idea to start higher studies early than later. </p>
                          
                           <p> It's not always possible for everyone to start Ph.D. studies just right after the BS graduation, especially someone like me from a lower-middle-class family. I got another issue just before my graduation. My father was disabled after a major health issue and I stopped taking money from my parents. I wanted to support my family as much as possible. On the other hand, the higher study also requires some monetary investment, e.g., GRE+TOEFL exam fee, foreign university application fee, etc. So, one needs to manage a handsome amount of money to start the application process. I think a one-year full-time job in a Software Company or teaching position in a University is enough in the perspective of our country (Bangladesh). Anyway, I waited for more than that (especially for a family reason). Even, I got an admission offer from Stony Brook University for Fall 2016 with full-funding but did not accept it which was a bad idea, in my opinion. Don't know why I waited so long. However, I was improving my research profile at that time which was a good thing for a career path in academia. Anyway, I started my Ph.D. studies in Fall 2017. In summary, I saw that while studying in the USA with full funding, one can save the same amount of money similar to doing a full-time job in Bangladesh. In addition, MS or Ph.D. degree is a bonus point. So, my suggestion would be to start the higher study early if someone wants to do so.</p>

                           <p> Now, if everyone in a batch finishes the higher study at the same time, remember that those international students from other countries will have the same years of experience though they are younger but smarter. They will get an early advantage in their career (especially in the industry). Don't know what would happen to the future, but being proactive in various decisions/works is always rewarding. In the worst case, one can abort the decision or change the path. </p>

                           <p> Many people change their thinking about career while studying in the USA. Many people choose academia over industry and vice-versa. It depends on the perspective. No matter what is the career path, if someone starts early they get advantages in the years of experience in many cases. And higher study being a primary entry to the USA job market for many students, no international students would like to procrastinate. I observe that most higher study admission seekers from Bangladesh, especially from public universities, wait two years to study the higher study. It is not a good idea, in my opinion. I would not delay if knew such situations in the higher studies. While doing a full-time job in Bangladesh, only one person reminded me about higher study many times (Zahid sir). I found him a very good person and am thankful to him for any suggestions. Finally, I accepted the opportunity from the CS department of Indiana University Bloomington and started my Ph.D. in Fall 2017. </p>
