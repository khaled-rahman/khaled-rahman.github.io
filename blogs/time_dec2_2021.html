                           <h2>Preparation is one of the keys to succeed in a job interview</h2>
                           <p> BUET is the top engineering university in Bangladesh. Sometimes, some bright students fail to get admitted to BUET due to some unavoidable situations or unforced errors. But, they can recover somehow, no matter wherever they study. In the job market of Bangladesh, employers also prioritize and intend to select BUETians based on quality and assessment. While studying at BUET, I also saw that my seniors got the good-paying job after graduation. So, when I got a BS in CSE from BUET, I thought getting a job would be easy. But, I was very wrong about it!</p>
                           <p> I needed to consider the competition in the job market. Each year almost 120 students (the year 2013) graduate from CSE BUET. Similarly, CS graduates from other universities become available in the job market. So, the competition is heavy just like the admission test of undergraduate studies. Having a high CGPA does not mean that a student will perform well in the job interview. One needs to prepare well for it. I didn't have a fixed goal for my career, should I go to academia or industry? I participated in on-campus recruitment exams without any preparation. Specifically, my mindset was like "I will get a job like my seniors". This type of mindset directs a person to fail, especially when merit or skill is a factor irrespective of CGPA. The questions on those on-campus recruitment exams were really interesting and puzzling. I liked the questions. I answered some questions based on my programming knowledge but always felt like I should have taken preparation for it. Again, I got calls from some employers based on how I performed on that recruitment exams. But, on the in-person technical interview, I could not satisfy the interviewers well because of my lack of preparation. I knew it because I did not prepare well. It is not like I would succeed if took preparation. It is more or less like I would know what were my lackings if I failed. Not last but the least, I appeared in most of the job interviews after graduation without preparation. Later I learned from the system and followed it. Many classmates succeeded, but I know that they also had some failures. </p>

                           <p>After some unsuccessful attempts, I got a job offer (still without proper preparation) for a software engineering position. The official time was 9 AM to 5 PM which disappointed me. And the office location was a bit away from my living place. I really worked with motivation and developed two android applications within just two months. But, it was boring and so I was looking for a teaching position in academia. In the first attempt, I failed but in the second attempt, I succeeded. Again, I would like to mention that CGPA does not add up unless you do well in the interview. I always thought like my position in our class is n, so the top 4~5 will join in CSE BUET and others from n-1 will go to another university. So, I hoped I would get that job with my class n-th ranking. This was very wrong. I was also failing due to a lack of career advice. Specifically, I asked for help or suggestions during my BS study from many senior brothers but did not seek fruitful suggestions/advice on how to succeed in the job interview. It was a factor. It is always a good idea to seek help from those who succeeded previously and how did they prepare. Sometimes, it is difficult to get exact information but one can always get hints. Anyway, I was continuing that academic position but always felt like I was not improving my skill set. Taking classes and teaching what I already know help to improve my understanding of the topic, but it does not extend the knowledge or skill unless I do research or learn something new. </p>

                           <p>So, I always feel like suggesting to others about taking preparation for any types of exams, or interviews. No matter what is the situation, prepare well ahead. Don't take anything for guaranteed. And don't lose hope even if you fail after a well-prepared interview or exam. You will see better outcome soon!</p>
